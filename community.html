            <h3>A Caring Community Seeks Solutions That Help Not Hurt</h3>
            <br>
            <h5><i>Park Hill neighborhood is known as a beacon of ……..List of how Park Hill supports the unhoused and other “social justice stuff” Denver Children’s Home, Denver Rescue Mission, Catholic Charities and many churches in the neighborhood support the unhoused in a responsibly and respectfully.</i></h5>
            <p>The Park Hill Methodist Church promotes themselves as leaders of social justice and community collaboration. Counter to their values, the church secretly worked with the CVC and the City, solidifying the TSOS planning without offering a caring neighborhood any opportunity for input or collaboration.  According to the church and City Councilman Herndon, they are under no legal obligation to do so. Is this how we want Denver neighborhoods to operate? Small, temporary solutions created in secret by a few without adequate resources or appropriate planning means big, potentially permanent problems for many.</p>
            <br>
            <h5><i>Sanctioned encampments are best understood as an interim solution to address the immediate conditions of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Such encampments are not themselves a solution to homelessness, and cities will need to invest in permanent solutions, such as housing that is affordable to extremely low-income people, permanent supportive housing, mental health services, affordable healthcare, and perhaps also supervised drug consumption sites and low-barrier employment opportunities (Junejo, Skinner, and Rankin, 2016; Loftus-Farren, 2011; Parr, 2018). Currently, limited evidence suggests that sanctioned encampments help to reduce homelessness; we also do not know whether certain types of sanctioned encampments are more effective than others"</i></h5>

            <h3>Lack of Transparency and Excluding Community Input</h3>
            <p><strong>Responsible planning and process now replaced with hope and prayers...</strong>
                The preschool and the neighborhood wish they could have been a part of the planning prior to the decision to place 45 unhoused and unknown individuals in an operational preschool parking lot, for 6 months, outdoors, in the sweltering summer and bitter winter seasons.</p>
            <p>The church prays the havoc inevitably created by over 45 sleeping tents,communal tents, generators,storage containers, pet areas, porta potties, showers, laundry facilities, daily food and supply deliveries occurring on a narrow residential block will matter less to the public than their attempted goodwill</p>
            <p>Everyone hopes the neighborhood stays safe for all its residents - permanent and temporary - while depending on a church volunteer list to support the CVC staff of one.</p>
            <p>The city silently watches this experiment unfold while absolving themselves of any responsibility or accountability if and when things go awry.</p>
            <h5><i>“Before communities make the decision to create such environments, it is important to weigh the costs and consequences of that action, and the impact on the community’s systemic efforts to end homelessness. If your community is exploring this step, here are a few cautions we think you should consider and discuss. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Creating these environments may make it look and feel like the community is taking action to end homelessness on the surface—but, by themselves, they have little impact on reducing homelessness."</u>
