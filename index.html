        <h3>Sustainable Options for Success </h3>

        <p>Denver’s homelessness crisis is spiraling out of control. Currently, more than 25% of the city’s homeless population is living on the streets, experiencing significant hardship.</p>

        <p>The City of Denver’s response to the crisis has been unstable, unsustainable and unsafe. Their latest band-aid solution is to relegate tent cities to our residential neighborhoods with complete disregard for adequate services and support.</p>

        <p>Instead of directly helping our unhoused neighbors with permanent options, the city is now paying understaffed and under-qualified organizations to experiment with our homeless population and with our residential neighborhoods. They are not providing the necessary resources nor the oversight to ensure appropriate security, safety and sanitation. Everyone is compassionately concerned.</p>

        <p>People experiencing homelessness deserve a dignified, thoughtful response to their needs. Packing tents into small residential areas located miles from needed resources and support is not the appropriate answer. We need a permanent location for temporary housing.</p>

        <p>The city cannot ignore this problem any longer. We should not experiment with people’s lives.</p>
        
        <h5><em>“Before communities make the decision to create such environments, it is important to weigh the costs and consequences of that action, and the impact on the community’s systemic efforts to end homelessness. If your community is exploring this step, here are a few cautions we think you should consider and discuss: • Creating these environments may make it look and feel like the community is taking action to end homelessness on the surface—but, by themselves, they have little impact on reducing homelessness." - United States Interagency Council On Homelesness."</em></h5>
