        <p>Denver’s homeless population has outpaced its available transitional housing, creating a citywide crisis. This emergency worsens as the City shuffles people experiencing homelessness between temporary campsites, destabilizing their lives and interrupting their access to services. These men and women deserve a more thoughtful response to their needs and a more comprehensive plan with permanent solutions.
        <br/>
        <strong>The City of Denver is providing neither a comprehensive plan or permanent solution.</strong>
        <br/>
        <h5><i>"Denver’s Department of Housing Stability is seeking proposals from land owners and service providers interested in helping the city stand up temporary sanctioned camping sites for people experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 emergency."</i> 
        <br/>~ October 29, 2020</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
        Now the City exacts emergency zoning laws as a new tactic to avoid responsibility and displace people. Private contractors funded by the City desperately try to help the unhoused with permanent places. The City refuses to provide a location. Without offering solutions, the City now permits experiments with our unhoused population and our residential neighborhoods. Outdoor tent compounds called “low barrier emergency shelters'' will preside in neighborhood church and school parking lots. Isolating the unhoused miles away from essential resources and support leaves the unhoused still without permanent solutions to their housing needs.
        </p> 
        <p>
        Zoning laws don’t require the City to notify or involve neighborhoods in the decision making and planning process. What’s worse: the City has no plans to provide additional and necessary resources nor the oversight to ensure appropriate security, safety and sanitation. Temporary sites are not a stable solution to Denver’s homelesness crisis. Not only are they expensive, these makeshift camps perpetuate the cycle of instability and can wreak havoc on the hosting residential neighborhoods.
        <br/>
        <strong>The City should not deflect responsibily and experiment with people’s lives.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Homeslessness is a significant human rights issue. The city of Denver continues to haphazardly deflect their duty to provide sustainable solutions and improve the crisis. The City must provide permanent places, not temporary spaces for the uhhoused. 
        </p>

        <h5><i> “Before communities make the decision to create such environments, it is important to weigh the costs and consequences of that action, and the impact on the community’s systemic efforts to end homelessness. If your community is exploring this step, here are a few cautions we think you should consider and discuss: • Creating these environments may make it look and feel like the community is taking action to end homelessness on the surface—but, by themselves, they have little impact on reducing homelessness." - United States Interagency Council On Homelesness.</i>
