        <h3>The Residential Experiment</h3>
        <p>Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) will host the first experimental site at the Park Hill United Methodist Church (PHUMC) in the Park Hill neighborhood. The location is nearly four miles away from other unsanctioned communities and CVC’s current temporary residence. The location lacks affordable grocery stores, services and enough RTD bus stops to support the population.</p>
        <p>Students from at least seven area schools walk by United Methodist Church on a daily basis. These young residents are often unaccompanied by an adult. These schools include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Children’s Center at Park Hill United Methodist Church 
                (serving over 50 children under the age of five.)</li>
            <li>Blessed Sacrament Catholic School (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>Montview Presbyterian Preschool (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>McAuliffe International School (more than 300 middle school students)</li>
            <li>Park Hill Elementary School (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>The Odyssey School (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>Stedman Elementary (how many kids total?)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Who is the Colorado Village Collaborative?</h3>
        <p>The Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) is a non-profit that the City has entrusted with solving Denver’s homeless crisis. The organization claims that “Safe Outdoor Spaces are healthy, secure, staffed, resource and service-rich environments.” Yet, according to CVC plans, only one paid staff member will be onsite at all times to assist, manage security and maintain sanitation for the residents and pets.</p>
        <p>From 6 am-8 pm, only one CVC site manager will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversee daily wellness screening and meal prep</li>
            <li>Monitor security and safety of residents</li>
            <li>Handle conflict resolution among residents</li>
            <li>Refer residents to external services and healthcare</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CVC will train residents to handle their own security during the day and sanitation at all times.</p>
        <p>From 8 pm-6 am, only one CVC security person will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversee security</li>
            <li>Handle conflict resolution among residents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other CVC staff will be consistently onsite. Instead, church and other volunteers who receive two hours of training will provide the “secure, resource and service-rich environment” for residents and the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The CVC recognizes that residents are better served when encampments are closer to city services and other sanctioned sites. Considering the plan for the UMC site, it's easy to see why. But, without City support, the CVC has been unable to secure a location to adequately support its residents.</p>
        <h3>Why is safety a concern in a residential neighborhood?</h3>
        <p>People experiencing homelesness need not be feared. Understaffed, under-resourced camps are the real danger for all involved because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alcohol and drugs use.</strong> Residents can drink and use drugs in their tents. While the official rule states that drinking is not allowed outside of the tents, the CVC will not prevent alcohol and drug use from happening inside of the tents and in the neighborhood streets and parks.</li>
            <li><strong>No drug testing.</strong> The CVC is not planning to drug test residents. While they promote the sites as alcohol and drug free, TSOS sites (**Proposal hyperlink**) are harm-reduction facilities and follow low-barrier housing principles when not on government property.<p><a href="https://www.springsrescuemission.org/what-it-means-to-be-a-low-barrier-homeless-shelter/" target="_blank">Read More Here on Low Barrier Sites Here</a></p></li>
            <li><strong>High rates of mental illness.</strong> While we don’t yet know the background of the residents, statistics about the unhoused population are clear.
                <ul>
                    <li>Seventy-one percent of people experiencing homelessness have a mental illness or post-traumatic stress.</li>
                    <li>Fifty-nine percent struggle with long-term substance use disorders (SUDs).</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lack of onsite services.</strong> This population needs compassionate and comprehensive support. CVC plans are insufficient and city services are nowhere nearby.</li>
        </ul>
