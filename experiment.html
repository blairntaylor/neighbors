        <h3>The Residential Experiment</h3>
        <p>Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) will host the first experimental site at the Park Hill United Methodist Church (PHUMC) in the Park Hill neighborhood. The location is nearly four miles away from other unsanctioned communities and CVC’s current temporary residence. The location lacks affordable grocery stores, services and enough RTD bus stops to support the population.</p>
        <p>Students from at least seven area schools walk by United Methodist Church on a daily basis. These young residents are often unaccompanied by an adult. These schools include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Children’s Center at Park Hill United Methodist Church 
                (serving over 50 children under the age of five.)</li>
            <li>Blessed Sacrament Catholic School (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>Montview Presbyterian Preschool (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>McAuliffe International School (more than 300 middle school students)</li>
            <li>Park Hill Elementary School (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>The Odyssey School (how many kids total?)</li>
            <li>Stedman Elementary (how many kids total?)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Who is the Colorado Village Collaborative?</h3>
        <p>The Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) is a non-profit that the City has entrusted with solving Denver’s homeless crisis. The organization claims that “Safe Outdoor Spaces are healthy, secure, staffed, resource and service-rich environments.” Yet, according to CVC plans, only one paid staff member will be onsite at all times to assist, manage security and maintain sanitation for the residents and pets.</p>
        <p>From 6 am-8 pm, only one CVC site manager will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oversee daily wellness screening and meal prep</li>
            <li>Monitor security and safety of residents</li>
            <li>Handle conflict resolution among residents</li>
            <li>Refer residents to external services and healthcare</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CVC will train residents to handle their own security during the day and sanitation at all times. </p>
