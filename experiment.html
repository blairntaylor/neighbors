        <h3>The Residential Experiment</h3>
        <p>The first experimental site in a residential area will be hosted by the Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) in the Park Hill neighborhood at the United Methodist Church. The location is nearly four miles away from other unsanctioned communities, CVC’s current temporary residence. It is blocks away from RTD lines, affordable grocery stores, and other support services.  A Children’s Center operates on the premises where the camp will be located, and serves over 50 children under the age of 5. Blessed Sacrament Catholic School a pre-school, elementary and middle school is 3 blocks away, Montview Presbyterian preschool is 4 blocks away. McAuliffe International School with over 300 sixth, seventh and eighth graders students, DPS elementary schools Park Hill Elementary School, The Odyssey School and Stedman Elementary are all less than a mile away. Students from each of these schools use the site’s sidewalk daily, often unaccompanied by an adult. More than 30 children live within 200 yards of the site.  Countless young families fill every block in the surrounding area. </p>
        <h3>Who is the CVC?</h3>
        <p>The Colorado Village Collaborative is a well-intentioned, but dangerously understaffed not-for-profit that the city has entrusted to solve Denver’s homelessness.</p>
        <p>The CVC website claims that “these Safe Outdoor Spaces are healthy, secure, staffed, resource and service-rich environments.” Upon review of their paperwork, this is clearly not the case. </p>
        <p>CVC is planning to provide only one paid staff member onsite at all times to assist all of its residents and maintain neighborhood security and sanitation.</p>
        <p><strong>ONE</strong> paid site manager will be onsite from 6am-8pm and will be responsible for all of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Overseeing daily wellness screening, safety, security, clean ups and meal prep</li>
            <li>Handling any conflict resolution with residents.</li>
            <li>Referring residents to external services and healthcare.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>ONE</strong> paid security person will be on site from 8pm - 6am when the site manager leaves for the evening. </p>
        <p>The residents of the site will be trained to handle their own security during the day and their own sanitation at all times. </p>
        <p>The rest of the staff are not consistently onsite, their expertise is not verified and they are not even hired by the CVC. Instead, volunteers with two hours worth of training are sourced from the church and other organizations.  This haphazard staffing experiment is how the CVC hopes to ensure a “secure, resource and service-rich environment” for its residents and the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The CVC itself prefers these camps be located closer to city services and other sanctioned campsites. Considering the plan for site support, it's easy to see why. CVC recognizes that residents are better served with nearby services and adequate infrastructure to support their needs. But without the support of the Mayor and other city officials, the CVC has been unable to secure a location to adequately support its residents.</p>
        <h3>Why is safety a concern in a residential neighborhood?</h3>
        <p>People experiencing homelesness need not be feared. Understaffed, under-resourced camps far-removed from services and support are the real danger for all involved.</p>
        <p>The CVC will not drug test residents of the camp. While their paperwork promotes the sites as alcohol and drug free, TSOS sites (****Proposal hyperlink), are harm reduction facilities and follow low-barrier(****article hyperlink) housing principles when not on government property.</p>

        <p>This is the reason the CVC advised preschool parents and neighbors that will not drug test their residents.  The low-barrier housing principles they follow means <strong>individuals staying in the camp are free to drink or use drugs inside of their personal tents.</strong> Technically it might not be allowed outside of the tents within the campsite, but the <strong>CVC will not prevent alcohol and drug use from happening inside of the tents and in the neighborhood streets and parks.</strong></p>
        <p>Facts about the future residents of the camp are unknown. Statistics about the unhoused population are clear.  71 percent of people experiencing homelessness have a mental illness or post-traumatic stress. 59 percent are struggling with long term substance use disorders (SUDs).13 Compassionate and comprehensive support is needed for this community. The CVC provides little.</p>

        <h5><em>"There are very few of these that have actually functioned as they should,” said Seattle safety advocate Ari Hoffman. “Overwhelmingly, they have been a colossal failure.” Hoffman, an active community member in Seattle, ran for a seat on the Seattle City Council after a camp near his synagogue’s cemetery led to a crime wave. Property damage to the cemetery cost his congregation roughly $200,000, Hoffman said. “We were finding feces everywhere,” he said. “Needles everywhere, people were hacking into the utilities."</em></h5>
