    <h3>Safe Outdoor Space</h3>

            <li>Link to the Emergency Temporary Zoning Ordinance</li>
            <p>Ordinance is dependent on the State and City COVID orders

    <h3> What are Temporary Safe Outdoor Spaces?</h3>
        <p>Temporary Safe Outdoor Spaces (TSOS) turn parking lots into sanctioned outdoor housing communities made up of personal and communal tents, generators, storage containers, pet areas, portable toilets, showers, laundry facilities, daily food and supply deliveries.</p>

    <h3> Denver's Process for Building a Tent City</h3>
        <p>Neither the City nor the hosting organization is required to inform or involve neighbors in the decision-making and planning process. The City does not need to provide additional transportation or services to serve the new tent city residents.</p>
        <p>As a result of the pandemic, the City altered zoning codes to allow unhoused populations to build tent cities in outdoor spaces owned by non-profit organizations or government entities (for example, churches and schools). The State is considering extending these permits until the economy recovers.</p>
        <h3>Not all sanctioned outdoor spaces are equal.</h3>
        <p>
            Research suggests TSOS work for everyone in the community when strategically located in areas where  unhoused populations already live and city social services are easily accessible. Residential neighborhoods do not offer the services people experiencing homelessness need. Denver understands that residential neighborhoods are not well-suited to host TSOS’ . That’s why the city hasn’t approved it in the past.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, fast and easy fixes are too appealing. Officials are relieved to delegate their responsibility while having no grasp on the impact on safety, sanitation and the neighborhood families with young children.</p>
