    <h3>What are Temporary Safe Outdoor Spaces? Why Residential Areas?</h3>
        <p>Temporary Safe Outdoor Spaces are sanctioned, temporary outdoor housing communities made up of tents in parking lots.</p>

        <p>After changing the zoning code during the COVID-19 pandemic, any outdoor space connected to a non-profit organization or government entity (for example, churches and schools) can now hold a tent community.  The state is currently considering extending these permits until the end of the economic impact - not the end of the pandemic. The problem? <strong>Neighborhoods do not need to be informed or involved in the planning.  Additional transportation and services do not need to be added to serve the new unhoused population.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Not all sanctioned outdoor spaces are the same.</strong> Research suggests Temporary Safe Outdoor Spaces safely help <strong>when strategically located near unsanctioned tent communities and city services.</strong>  Residential neighborhoods do not fit these standards.  Standards, and the people they impact, matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Denver understands this but as the crisis looms, fast and easy fixes are too appealing. There is a reason why the city has never allowed tenting in residential neighborhoods before. The city knows that temporary camps in exclusively residential neighborhoods do not make sense. Officials have no grasp on the impact on safety and sanitation. There are no supporting resources in the area, limited transportation options, and a significant level of schools and families with young children living nearby. It might be the worst possible place to attempt to make things better.
